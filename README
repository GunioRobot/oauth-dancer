h1. Welcome to the OAuth Dance

While this tool is still in its infancy, it actually works now for most basic kinds of requests you might make against an OAuth 1.0a Service Provider.

* It allows you to define Service Providers, and the consumer keys and secrets associated with them.
* It allows you to authenticate against Service Providers, starting with acquiring a request token, then authorizing, then getting an access tokens.
* Access Tokens are persisted so you can use them again later for more requests.
* Make arbitrary API calls against a Service Provider by specifying the URL, HTTP Method, and a POST body of any Content-Type
* SQLite back-end makes your database portable and saves you in DB setup time

h2. How To Install
* Clone this project, then step into the directory
* Run rake db:create:all to create your databases
* Run rake db:migrate to migrate the database to the proper structures
* Run ./script/server and browse to http://localhost:3000 to make it all happen

h2. Future Features
* Set HTTP headers for a request arbitrarily
* Manipulate the OAuth steps to test unusual scenarios
* Out of Band mode support
* Two-legged OAuth support

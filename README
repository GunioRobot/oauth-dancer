h1. Welcome to the OAuth Dance

While this tool is still in its infancy, it actually works now for most basic kinds of requests you might make against an OAuth 1.0a Service Provider.

* It allows you to define Service Providers, and the consumer keys and secrets associated with them.
* It allows you to authenticate against Service Providers, starting with acquiring a request token, then authorizing, then getting an access tokens.
* Access Tokens are persisted so you can use them again later for more requests.
* Make arbitrary API calls against a Service Provider by specifying the URL, HTTP Method, and a POST body of any Content-Type

h2. Future Features
* Set HTTP headers for a request arbitrarily
* Manipulate the OAuth steps to test unusual scenarios
* Out of Band mode support
* Two-legged OAuth support
